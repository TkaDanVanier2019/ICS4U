# ICS4U

About me:
A majority of my programming experience is centered around ICS courses that I took from grade 10 to grade 12. These courses were the place where I learnt the basics of computer science and worked on improving my coding abilities. During the courses I was solving various 
data structure problems and writing basic sorting/search algorithms. As a result, the courses allowed me to acquire experience in writing well-structured code. Some of my school projects included writing a text adventure game (TAG) and a database prototype. On top of the ICS courses, I have had a chance to work on a couple of smaller-scale software and hardware extracurricular projects. One of them was a Weather Station accessed via web service, which was done using Arduino (C/C++). 
In the past three years I had a chance to use different languages, becoming proficient in some of them to a certain extent. Below are the languages in which I feel comfortable:
1. Turing
2. Pascal
3. Python
4. C#
5. Arduino (C/C++)

Aspirations:
While I do not plan to major in computer science, I realize the importance that computer programming plays in our lives and see it as a useful tool that is helpful in solving problems. Furthermore, going into engineering, I know that CS plays an important role in this discipline and many classes require a thorough understanding of computer science concepts. Thus, I want to prepare myself for next year and years to follow in order to be well equipped with relevant knowledge and ready to learn new concepts rights away.

Things I like about programming:
The idea that fascinates me the most is building things out of nothing. And while it is not necessarily true since I use the pre existing software and hardware, it does often feel this way. I enjoy making various programs from scratch and then seeing them work, knowing that I started from an empty source code editor. Furthermore, I like the precision that coding requires but at the same time I enjoy the open endedness of the solutions and various approaches through which certain problems can be solved. Furthermore, I enjoy solving puzzles and programming is full of them. Moreover, I enjoy the fact that when coding I always learn new things. After all, programming usually involves reading various documentations and lots of googling, StackOverflow browsing.

Things I do not like about programming as much:
While I have said that I enjoy the precision of coding, it can often be frustrating. It might seem fun but sometimes a misplaced semicolon or a typing mistake can be too much, causing long periods of confusion and frustrations. On top of this, the amount of time that can be wasted without moving closer to a final goal can also add to the feeling of delirium. Also, while I have said that I enjoy the open endedness of the solutions, the ambiguity of certain problems and the paramount component of trial and error that comes with hours of experimentation is something that does not sit well with me (especially when there are due dates).
